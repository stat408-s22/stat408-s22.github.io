Then answer the following questions:

a. Discuss one feature of the data visualization that adheres to good data visualization principles and explain why.
b. Discuss one feature of the data visualization that does not adhere to good data visualization principles or that could be improved and explain why.
c. What does the data visualization make you understand that, say, a written version of the same data likely wouldnâ€™t?



## 3.
Select one of the data sets we have used in class (e.g., BaltimoreTowing.csv, Bike.csv, SeattleHousing.csv or one of the scraped data sets). Create a compelling graphic that adheres to the design principles from class. Include a written summary of the story your graphic displays and explain how it adheres to good data visualization design principles.
