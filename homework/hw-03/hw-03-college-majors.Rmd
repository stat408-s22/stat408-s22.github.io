The first step in the process of turning information into knowledge process is to summarize and describe the raw information -- the data.
In this assignment we explore data on college majors and earnings, specifically the data used in the FiveThirtyEight story ["The Economic Guide To Picking A College Major"](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-economic-guide-to-picking-a-college-major/).

These data originally come from the American Community Survey (ACS) 2010-2012 Public Use Microdata Series.
While this is outside the scope of this assignment, if you are curious about how raw data from the ACS were cleaned and prepared, see [the code](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/college-majors/college-majors-rscript.R) FiveThirtyEight authors used.

We should also note that there are many considerations that go into picking a major.
Earnings potential and employment prospects are two of them, and they are important, but they don't tell the whole story.
Keep this in mind as you analyze the data.

# Getting started

* Open RStudio. Navigate to File > New Project..., and select "New Directory", then "New Project". Name your directory something like "hw-03" and save it as a subdirectory of your STAT 408 folder on your computer. Click "Create Project".
* Download the [R Markdown document `hw-03.Rmd`](hw-03.Rmd) from the course calendar and save it to your newly created "hw-03" folder.
* Open the `hw-03.Rmd` document in RStudio. Update the YAML, changing the author name to your name, and **knit** the document to PDF.
* Make sure it compiles without errors. The output will be in the `.pdf` file with the same name in the same directory.

## Packages

```{marginfigure}
Reminder: If you get the error <span style="color: red;"> `Error in library(xyz) : there is no package called ‘xyz’` </span>, then you need to install that package either by using the `install.packages()` function in the console, or by going to the Packages tab and clicking Install. You only need to install packages once, but you need to load them using the `library()` function in each R session.
```

We'll use the **tidyverse** package for much of the data wrangling and visualization, the **scales** package for better formatting of labels on visualizations, and the data live in the **fivethirtyeight** package. The following code to load these packages is included at the beginning of `hw-03.Rmd`:

```{r load-packages, message = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(scales)
library(fivethirtyeight)
```

## Data

The data can be found in the **fivethirtyeight** package, and are called `college_recent_grads`.
Since the dataset is distributed with the package, we don't need to load it separately; it becomes available to us when we load the package.
You can find out more about the dataset by inspecting its documentation, which you can access by running `?college_recent_grads` in the Console or using the Help menu in RStudio to search for `college_recent_grads`.
You can also find this information [here](https://fivethirtyeight-r.netlify.app/reference/college_recent_grads.html).

```{marginfigure}
It's always important to understand the [**observational unit**](https://mtstateintrostats.github.io/IntroStatTextbook/intro-to-data.html#data-basics) (one case, or one row) in a dataset. In this dataset, one observational unit is one college major (not one college graduate).
```

You can also take a quick peek at your data frame and view its dimensions with the `glimpse` function.

```{r glimpse}
glimpse(college_recent_grads)
```

The `college_recent_grads` data frame is a trove of information.
Let's think about some questions we might want to answer with these data:

-   Which major has the lowest unemployment rate?
-   Which major has the highest percentage of women?
-   How do the distributions of median income compare across major categories?
-   Do women tend to choose majors with lower or higher earnings?

In the next sections we aim to answer these questions.

# Warm up

## Which major has the lowest unemployment rate?

In order to answer this question all we need to do is sort the data.
We use the `arrange` function to do this, and sort it by the `unemployment_rate` variable.
By default `arrange` sorts in ascending order, which is what we want here -- we're interested in the major with the *lowest* unemployment rate.

```{r lowest-unemp}
college_recent_grads %>%
  arrange(unemployment_rate)
```

This gives us what we wanted, but not in an ideal form.
First, the name of the major barely fits on the page.
Second, some of the variables are not that useful (e.g. `major_code`, `major_category`) and some we might want front and center are not easily viewed (e.g. `unemployment_rate`).

We can use the `select` function to choose which variables to display, and in which order:

```{marginfigure}
Note how easily we expanded our code with adding another step to our pipeline,
with the pipe operator: `%>%`.
```

```{r lowest-unemp-select}
college_recent_grads %>%
  arrange(unemployment_rate) %>%
  select(rank, major, unemployment_rate)
```

Ok, this is looking better, but do we really need to display all those decimal places in the unemployment variable?
Not really!

We can use the `percent()` function to clean up the display a bit.

```{r}
college_recent_grads %>%
  arrange(unemployment_rate) %>%
  select(rank, major, unemployment_rate) %>%
  mutate(unemployment_rate = percent(unemployment_rate))
```

# Exercises

## Which major has the highest percentage of women?


```{marginfigure}
Hint: Use the `desc()` function as an argument in the `arrange()` function.
```


1.  Using what you've learned so far, arrange the data in descending order with respect to proportion of women in a major, and display only the major, the total number of people with major, and proportion of women. Show only the top 3 majors by adding `top_n(3)` at the end of the pipeline.

## How do the distributions of median income compare across major categories?

```{marginfigure}
A percentile is a measure used in statistics indicating the value below which a given percentage of observations in a group of observations fall. For example, the 20th percentile is the value below which 20% of the observations may be found. (Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile))
```

There are three types of incomes reported in this data frame: `p25th`, `median`, and `p75th`.
These correspond to the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles of the income distribution of sampled individuals for a given major.

```{marginfigure}
Intro stat review: [Properties of the mean and median](https://mtstateintrostats.github.io/IntroStatTextbook/eda.html#robust-statistics)
```


2.  Why do we often choose the median, rather than the mean, to describe the typical income of a group of people?

```{marginfigure}
Note: Since each observational unit is one college major, "median income" is one of the variables measured on each major. Don't confuse the name of the variable ("median income") with the "median" summary statistic of that variable (the "median median income" across all college majors).
```

The question we want to answer is "How do the distributions of median income compare across major categories?".
We need to do a few things to answer this question: First, we need to group the data by `major_category`.
Then, we need a way to summarize the distributions of median income within these groups.
This decision will depend on the shapes of these distributions.
So first, we need to visualize the data.

```{marginfigure}
It's good practice to always think in the context of the data and try out a few binwidths before settling on a binwidth.
You might ask yourself: "What would be a meaningful difference in median incomes?" \$1 is obviously too little, \$10000 might be too high.
```

3.  Create a histogram of the distribution of all median incomes (without considering the major categories). Try binwidths of \$1000 and \$5000 and choose one. Explain your reasoning for your choice. Note that the binwidth is an argument for the `geom_histogram` function. So to specify a binwidth of \$1000, you would use `geom_histogram(binwidth = 1000)`.


We can also calculate summary statistics for this distribution using the `summarise` function:

```{r}
college_recent_grads %>%
  summarise(min = min(median), max = max(median),
            mean = mean(median), med = median(median),
            sd = sd(median), 
            q1 = quantile(median, probs = 0.25),
            q3 = quantile(median, probs = 0.75))
```


```{marginfigure}
Intro stat review: [How to describe the shape of the distribution of a quantitative variable](https://mtstateintrostats.github.io/IntroStatTextbook/eda.html#describing-and-comparing-quantitative-distributions)
```

4.  Based on the shape of the histogram you created in the previous exercise, determine which of these summary statistics is useful for describing the distribution.
    Write up your description of the distribution (remember shape, center, spread, any unusual observations) and include the summary statistic output as well.

5.  Again plot the distribution of `median` income using a histogram, but now faceted by `major_category`.
    Use the `binwidth` you chose in the earlier exercise.

Now that we've seen the shapes of the distributions of median incomes for each major category, we should have a better idea for which summary statistic to use to quantify the typical median income.

6.  Which major category has the highest typical (you'll need to decide what this means) median income? Use the partial code below, filling it in with the appropriate statistic and function. Also note that we are looking for the highest statistic, so make sure to arrange in the correct direction.

```{r eval=FALSE}
college_recent_grads %>%
  group_by(major_category) %>%
  summarise(___ = ___(median)) %>%
  arrange(___)
```

```{marginfigure}
Hint: Use the `count()` and `arrange()` functions.
```

7.  Which major category is the least popular in this sample? 

## All STEM fields aren't the same

One of the sections of the [FiveThirtyEight story](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-economic-guide-to-picking-a-college-major/) is "All STEM fields aren't the same".
Let's see if this is true.

First, let's create a new vector called `stem_categories` that lists the major categories that are considered STEM fields.

```{r}
stem_categories <- c("Biology & Life Science",
                     "Computers & Mathematics",
                     "Engineering",
                     "Physical Sciences")
```

Then, we can use this to create a new variable in our data frame indicating whether a major is STEM or not.

```{r}
college_recent_grads <- college_recent_grads %>%
  mutate(major_type = ifelse(major_category %in% stem_categories, "stem", "not stem"))
```

Let's unpack this: with `mutate` we create a new variable called `major_type`, which is defined as `"stem"` if the `major_category` is in the vector called `stem_categories` we created earlier, and as `"not stem"` otherwise.

`%in%` is a **logical operator**.
Other logical operators that are commonly used are

| Operator            | Operation                |
|:--------------------|:-------------------------|
| `x < y`             | less than                |
| `x > y`             | greater than             |
| `x <= y`            | less than or equal to    |
| `x >= y`            | greater than or equal to |
| `x != y`            | not equal to             |
| `x == y`            | equal to                 |
| `x %in% y`          | contains                 |
| <code>x \| y</code> | or                       |
| `x & y`             | and                      |
| `!x`                | not                      |

We can use the logical operators to also `filter` our data for STEM majors whose median earnings is less than median for all majors' median earnings, which we found to be \$36,000 earlier.

```{r}
college_recent_grads %>%
  filter(
    major_type == "stem",
    median < 36000
  )
```

8.  Which STEM majors have median salaries equal to or less than the median for all majors' median earnings? Your output should only show the major name and median, 25th percentile, and 75th percentile earning for that major and should be sorted such that the major with the highest median earning is on top.

## What types of majors do women tend to major in?

9.  Create a scatterplot of median income vs. proportion of women in that major, colored by whether the major is in a STEM field or not. Describe the association between these three variables.

## Further exploration

10. Ask a question of interest to you, and answer it using both summary statistic(s) and visualization(s).
