Each week, Tuesdays will be primarily lecture and class discussion or short activities, and Thursdays will be lab days. After spring break, we will switch the schedule and have labs Tuesdays and lecture Thursdays.

* **You should bring your laptop with you to every class period.**
* Assigned readings for the week should be completed prior to lab. Whether you learn better by reading prior to lecture, or hearing a lecture prior to reading is up to you.
* Weekly labs are due in GitHub by 5pm on the due date.
* Weekly homework assignments are due in D2L by 5pm on the due date.
